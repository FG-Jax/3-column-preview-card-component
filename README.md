## Overview

For my third independent html/css project, I decided to try to recreate this design for a product preview card Component. I used CSS Flexbox to center the entire card in the screen, and I used CSS grid to make the card more responsive.

## Built with
- CSS Flex
- CSS Grid

## What I learned
I can feel a bit more confident in recreating designs using flex and grid. I also learned to properly import fonts. In this project, I've also made use of position related css commands because I noticed that the provided designs weren't vertically centered.
